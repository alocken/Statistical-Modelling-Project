# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Connecting to and exploring new APIs to gather and analyze data to determine locations of bike sharing stations and points on interest (POI) within the radius of those stations. The bike sharing location selected was AlGira in the city of Almeirim and the points of interest selected were cafes and bars. The end goal of this project was to determine the correlation between the location of bike stations with the selected city and location of corresponding cafes/bars. 


Further exploration

 

Developed a regression model to

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
joining data was challenging as it required exploration of sets to determine how to join/merge sets
model building was a challenge as it required research to determine how to evaluate two sets of data to prpduce a comparative output - this took time and was a stretch as it required developing a grid and cells to evlautate loations of data and potential correlations. 

 
 


## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
I would spend more time filtering returned data and expanding the parameters.
